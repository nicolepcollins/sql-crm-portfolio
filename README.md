# 📊 SQL CRM Portfolio Project

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio project showcases my ability to **design and implement a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system** using **SQL** and **Google BigQuery**. It simulates a real-world business environment by modeling core CRM entities—**Customers, Leads, Contacts, and Opportunities**—and establishes relationships between them using a normalized relational schema.

The project emphasizes **data modeling**, **SQL schema creation**, and **cloud-based data warehousing skills**, with reusable components suitable for future CRM data analysis projects.
