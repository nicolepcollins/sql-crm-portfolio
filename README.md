#  SQL CRM Portfolio Project

##  Overview

This portfolio project showcases my ability to **design and implement a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system** using **SQL** and **Google BigQuery**. It simulates a real-world business environment by modeling core CRM entities—**Customers, Leads, Contacts, and Opportunities**—and establishes relationships between them using a normalized relational schema.

The project emphasizes **data modeling**, **SQL schema creation**, and **cloud-based data warehousing skills**, with reusable components suitable for future CRM data analysis projects.

##  Features

-  **Relational schema** with primary and foreign key constraints
-  **Google BigQuery** as the cloud data warehouse environment
-  **CSV data ingestion** through the BigQuery interface (free-tier compatible)
-  **Modular SQL scripts** for schema setup and querying
-  **Analysis-ready structure** for deriving business insights
-  Clean and organized folder structure to mirror professional standards
