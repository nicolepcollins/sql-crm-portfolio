## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using SQL on Google BigQuery. The goal was to create a relational schema modeling key CRM entities: Customers, Leads, Contacts, and Opportunities, and to load sample data for analysis.

## Features
- Relational schema creation with primary and foreign keys  
- Data upload via CSV files into BigQuery tables  
- SQL scripts to create tables and populate sample data  
- Structured to showcase SQL data modeling and ETL skills  

## Project Structure
- `schema_setup.sql` – Contains SQL code to create the CRM tables with relationships  
- `data_upload_instructions.md` – Step-by-step instructions on uploading CSV files to BigQuery  
- `sample_data/` – Folder containing CSV files for Customers, Leads, Contacts, and Opportunities  

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository  
2. Use Google BigQuery to create a new dataset  
3. Run the `schema_setup.sql` script to create the tables  
4. Upload CSV files from the `sample_data/` folder to their respective tables  
5. Start querying your CRM data for analysis and insights  

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL schema design and data modeling  
- Data loading and transformation in BigQuery  
- Use of primary keys, foreign keys, and relational integrity  
- Working with cloud-based data warehouses
